- The 4 stick figures is my family and I. My sister just moved to college and I miss her already.
- Below my family, there is a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and desktop. I really like to play video games.
- There is also a swimming pool because I like swimming as a hobby and exercise, although I'm not very good at it.
- The pair of headphones show my love for music. Music helps me get through tough times and helps me relax.


### This is my favorite video game!

- Valorant is just like CS-GO in the sense that you play 5v5 and try to kill the enemy team before they kill you. I managed to get the highest rank in the game and hit top #170 in North America.
