    "- My project is an employment predictor which takes inputs such as the applicant's education level, employment, gender, years coded, and years coded pro and predicts if they will get the job or not. The model is built on job applicant data from 70,000 people and if they were accepted or not. These jobs were software/computer science related. This relates to my CPT project which was a job finder that connected freelancer and employers because it predicts if that person will get the job or not."
