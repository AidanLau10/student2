In this case, in the filter_application_qualification function, arguments for qualification and jobid are passed in. The first step in the algorithmn is to check which qualification was passsed and the next step is to create a set of user ids that had the same qualification in their application by job id.\n",

    "- This code segment contained in the filter_application_qualification function searches through a list and uses object oriented design to query a database which returns a dictionary. In the first line, a list of user ids that match the qualification and jobid is created using the set operation. There are two searches that occur when the Application database is queried for the specific qualification and jobid and the User database is queried by the specific user id. These are also examples of object oriented programming because the User and Application tables are classes within Python which contain variables/attributes such as qualification, jobid, and userid. The final item returned is a dictionary of users which contain key/value pairs such as the user's name, id, and status."
