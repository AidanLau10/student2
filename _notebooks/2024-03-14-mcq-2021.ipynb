    "- 11000 is the binary value for jump. My thinking was that the the power that you are raising to is the number from right to left. The two ones are in the 4 and 5 position so I thought that 2^4 + 2^5 = 16 + 32 = 48. However, the count starts from 0 so it is 2^3 + 2^4 = 8 + 16 = 24.\n",

    "- The expression will evaluate to true when the average customer rating is greater than or equal to 4 AND the price range is either medium or low. I chose the incorrect option that BOTH the the price range had to be low and medium but thats not possible for one resturant to have 2 possible price ranges.\n",

    "- I chose D correct as it checks input1 AND input2 and then switches the value of the boolean expression. A is the other correct answer because it switches the value of input1 and input2 then checks if at least one of them is true. For three of the cases, true and false; false and true; false and false, at least one of the values will be true which will set the end result to true. The last case is true and true which will be switched to false and false and the end result will be false.\n",

This will loop until it checks all the elements in the list. This code won't work for A because the final list will be [10,20,10] which still has duplicates. It also won't work for C because it won't remove anything but the final list will still have duplicates [30,50,40,10,20,40]\n",
