For example, I wouldn't ask the user if they took a shower because if they didn't then they wouldn't feel comfortable. Besides decreasing the risks of anything involving the user, it's important to add error handling, validation, and security to make sure any important data isn't leaked. For example, if you have a database of user passwords and sensitive data, you should encrypt it and use validation to make sure people don't steal data.\n"
