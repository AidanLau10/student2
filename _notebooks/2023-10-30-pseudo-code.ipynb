    "- The arrows kind of throw me off when assigning variables\n",
    "- I really like the blocks that separate the code segments\n",

    "- Assing variables values using arrows\n",
    "- Loops use \"Repeat Until\"\n",
    "- If and if else statements are the same as python\n",
    "- MOD is modulo and returns the remainder when dividing two numbers\n",
